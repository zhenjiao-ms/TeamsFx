# Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

## What is the Teams Toolkit?

The Teams Toolkit helps developers create and deploy Teams apps with integrated Identity, access to cloud storage, data from [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-concept-overview), and other services in [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/build-your-first-app/build-bot) and [M365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) with a “zero-configuration” approach to the developer experience.

## What are Teams app “Capabilities”?

Teams apps are a combination of [capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/capabilities-overview) and [entry points](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/extensibility-points). For example, people can chat with your app's bot (capability) in a channel (entry point).

### Tab
<a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/what-are-tabs>Tab</a> are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. They are simple HTML tags that point to domains declared in the app manifest and can be added as part of a channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user.

### Bot
<a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/what-are-bots>Bots</a> allow users to interact with your web service through text, interactive cards, and task modules.

### Messaging Extension
<a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions>Messaging extensions</a> allow users to interact with your web service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client.

>Don’t have a M365 to experience building Teams app? Sign up for [Microsoft Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program), which allows you to have a testing tenant with preconfigured permissions.

## Getting started

After installing the Teams toolkit, follow the [Get Started](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mods/build-your-first-app/build-first-app-overview?branch=main) instruction in our documentation to smoothly start with. 

Under the Teams Toolkit extension tab, you can easily discover all applicable commands in the sidebar and Command Palette with the keyword ‘TeamsFx’. It also supports [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/teamsfx-cli) to increase efficiency. 

### Create your project

Use the Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code to set up your first app project. Create your app project using the following steps:

- Ensure you've installed the Microsoft Teams Toolkit
- In Visual Studio Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / ⌘⇧-P or View -> Command - Palette) and type teams and choose TeamsFx - Start A New Project.
- Type a name for your project and hit Enter
- Next, Add capabilities comes up. Select capability you want then Next.
- Choose options according to your purpose, i.e., front-end hosting type, language, cloud resources and so on.
- Choose a location where your new application will be created in a new folder.

### Configure your app

At its core, the Teams app embraces three components:

- The Microsoft Teams client (web, desktop or mobile) where users interact with your app.
- A server that responds to requests for content that will be displayed in Teams, e.g., HTML tab content or a bot adaptive card .
- A Teams app package consisting of three files:

  ✔️ The manifest.json.

  ✔️ A color icon for your app to display in the public or organization app catalog.

  ✔️ An outline icon for display on the Teams activity bar.

When an app is installed, the Teams client parses the manifest file to determine needed information like the name of your app and the URL where the services are located.

- To configure your app, navigate to the Microsoft Teams Toolkit tab in Visual Studio Code.
- Go to Manifest Editor in the sidebar menu to edit the manifest.json of your Teams app.
- The toolkit will automatically update the app registration data accordingly during app side-loading and publish.

### Preview your app on your local/remote dev environment

Prerequisites: [Enable Teams developer preview mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro#enable-developer-preview)

Simply press F5 to run your first Teams or navigate to the Debug tab in the activity bar and select Run icon to display the Run and Debug view. As a default, the toolkit will automatically help you to setup local environment and load the app in Teams.

If you want to have a better estimation of how the app will behave in the cloud environment, you can deploy your resources to the cloud and preview your app with the backend running in the cloud (remote).

### Deploy your application to Azure

Deployment happens in two steps: Provisioning and Deployment. Provisioning creates all the necessary Azure resources that your application uses. It is typically done once. To provision your backend to an active Azure subscription:

- In the Visual Studio Code Command Palette, enter the command TeamsFx - Provision Resource.
- You will be asked to sign into your Azure account. This is the account where Azure resources will be provisioned. Typically this is different from the M365 account you used to sign in earlier.
- You will be asked to select a subscription to use from the Azure account.
- Once provisioning is completed, Visual Studio Code will popup the notification with the message "[Teams Toolkit] provision finished successfully".

Deploy copies your application to the provisioned Azure resources. It is typically done after every change to your application. To deploy your application to the provisioned resources in an active Azure subscription:

- In the Visual Studio Code Command Palette, enter the command TeamsFx - Deploy Package.
- Select Tab app and Backend to deploy.
- Once deploy is finished, go to the Visual Studio Code Debug Panel (Ctrl+Shift+D / ⌘⇧-D or View -> Run) and select Launch Remote (Edge).
- Press the start button (green arrow) to launch your app - now running remotely on Azure!

### Publish your application to Teams

When your application resources and infrastructure are deployed successfully, you can publish and register your app to Teams app catalog to share with others in your organization.

- In the Visual Studio Code Command Palette, enter the command TeamsFx - Publish to Teams.
- Depending on your permission, you can send your app to the admin portal directly, or manually submit the app package file to your admin to check.
- Once your app is approved by your admin, you can see it under ‘Built for your org’ section in Teams Apps.
