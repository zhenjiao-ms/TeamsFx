## Test the project

### Prepare test resources

You only need to take following steps once.
1. Register your M365 subscription at https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365. Record the username, password for your admin account, and tenant id for your M365 tenant.
2. Create an AAD app registration named `teamsfx-integration-test-main-app` using admin account from step 1. Record the client id of this app.
3. Configure the AAD app registration created in step 2:
    1. Add redirect uri: https://localhost. The redirect uri does not need to be valid. The test framework will parse the AAD response from redirect uri.
    2. Generate client secret, record the generated secret.
    3. Configure following application permission and grant admin consent for them in Azure Portal:
        1. Application.ReadWrite.All
        2. Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
        3. Policy.Read.All
        4. Policy.ReadWrite.ApplicationConfiguration
4. Create a test user account under M365 tenant. **Remember to update password after first sign in**.
5. Update the integration test configuration `./src/TeamsFxSimpleAuth.Tests/appsettings.IntegrationTest.json`
    ```
    "OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your-M365-tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/token",
    "IntegrationTestSettings": {
        "TenantId": "<your-M365-tenant-id>",
        "AdminClientId": "<your-main-app-client-id>",
        "AdminClientSecret": "<your-main-app-client-secret>",
        "AuthorizeUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your-M365-tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize",
        "ApiAppIdUri": "api://localhost",
        "RedirectUri": "https://localhost",
        "CodeVerifier": "CodeVerifier_for_SimpleAuth_Integration_test",
        "TestUsername": "<your-authorized-test-user-account>",
        "TestPassword": "<password-for-authorized-test-user-account>",
        "TestUsername2": "<your-another-authorized-test-user-account>",
        "TestPassword2": "<password-for-another-authorized-test-user-account>",
        "Scope": "access_as_user"
    }
    ```
