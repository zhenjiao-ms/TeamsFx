Called when a prompt dialog is the active dialog and the user replied with a new activity.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
continueDialog(dc: DialogContext): Promise<DialogTurnResult>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  dc | DialogContext | The DialogContext for the current turn of the conversation. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;DialogTurnResult&gt;

A `Promise` representing the asynchronous operation.

## Exceptions

[ChannelNotSupported](./teamsfx.errorcode.md) when bot channel is not MS Teams.
