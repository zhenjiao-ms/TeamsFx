Microsoft Teams Framework is a library encapsulating common functionality and integration patterns (like simplified access to Microsoft Identity) for developers building apps for Microsoft Teams.

The Teams Developer Platform offers a collection of solutions for Teams developers:
- IDE extensions for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code named "Teams Toolkit"
- Docs, samples
- Code libraries including Teams Framework `teamsfx` and the Teams Client Library `teams-js`
- A command line tool `teamsfx` for terminal users, automation, and CI

This repository contains the following packages:
| Package | Description | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Visual Studio Code Extension** <br/> [packages/vscode-extension](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/tree/main/packages/vscode-extension) | The extension named "Teams Toolkit" enables you to scaffold, run, debug, and deploy custom Teams apps directly from Visual Studio Code. It provides all the features of the CLI tool `teamsfx` integrated into the IDE, as well as easy access to more samples, docs and tools. |
| **TeamsFx CLI** <br/> [packages/cli](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/tree/main/packages/cli) | Whether you prefer keyboard-centric developer operations, or you are automating your CI/CD pipeline, the `teamsfx` command line tool offers the same features as the IDE extensions.  |
| **SDK**<br/> [packages/sdk](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/tree/main/packages/sdk) | The main TeamsFx code library encapsulating simple authentication for both client and server-side code tailored for Teams developers. |
| **API** <br/> [packages/api](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/tree/main/packages/api) | The TeamsFx API is a collection of contracts supported by the IDE Extensions and CLI. It enables developers to write plugins to extend TeamsFx with new capabilities. |
| **Core** <br/> [packages/fx-core](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/tree/main/packages/fx-core) | The Core package centralizes implementation of capabilities shared by the IDE Extensions and the CLI. |
| **Azure Functions Support** <br/> [packages/function-extension](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/tree/main/packages/function-extension) | TeamsFx helps developers include server-side code in their Teams application backed by [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/). This plugin adds support to simplify the integration of an authentication-aware Azure Function into your Teams app. |
| **Simple Auth** <br/> [packages/simpleauth](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/tree/main/packages/simpleauth) | This package adds support for server-side code necessary for client-side code to access services such as Microsoft Graph.|
