# Build Bots for Teams

A bot, chatbot, or conversational bot is an app that responds to simple commands sent in chat and replies in meaningful ways. Examples of bots in everyday use include: bots that notify about build failures, bots that provide information about the weather or bus schedules, or provide travel information. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation. Being a cloud application, a bot can provide valuable and secure access to cloud services and corporate resources.

This is a sample chatbot application demonstrating Single Sign-on using `botbuilder` and Teams Framework that can respond to a `hello` message.

## Prerequisites
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An M365 account, if you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Create an application
- From Visual Studio Code, open command palette and select `Teams - Start a new project`.
- From the CLI, (after `npm install -g teamsfx`) run command `teamsfx new`.
- Choose the bot capabilities from the prompts.
> Note: You have the option to reuse an existing bot by entering the credential manually. But make sure that bot is not associated with any AAD apps.

## Debug
Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key. Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Start Debugging` green arrow button.

## Build

* From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select `Teams: Build Teams Package`.
* From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx build` in the project directory.

## Validate manifest file

To check that your manifest file is valid or not:
* From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select: `Teams: Validate App Manifest File`.
* From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx validate` in your project directory.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure when itâ€™s ready by following these steps:

1. Log in to your Azure account
2. Select an active subscription
3. Provision your application resources in the cloud
4. Deploy your application to the cloud

You can do this using the Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code or using the TeamsFx CLI:

| Using Teams Toolkit| Using TeamsFx CLI|
| :------------------| :----------------|
| <ul><li>Open Teams Toolkit, and sign into Azure by clicking the `Sign in to Azure` under the `ACCOUNT` section from sidebar.</li> <li>After you signed in, select a subscription under your account.</li><li>Open the command palette and select: `Teams: Provision in the Cloud`.</li><li>Open the command palette and select: `Teams: Deploy to the Cloud`.</li></ul>  | <ul> <li>Run command `teamsfx account login azure`.</li> <li>Run command `teamsfx account set --subscription $subscriptionid`.</li> <li> Run command `teamsfx provision`.</li> <li>Run command: `teamsfx deploy`. </li></ul>|

>Note: This may incur costs in your Azure Subscription.

## Publish to Teams

Once deployed, you may want to submit your application to your organization's internal app store. Your app will be submitted for admin approval.

* From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select: `Teams: Publish to Teams`.
* From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx publish` in your project directory.
